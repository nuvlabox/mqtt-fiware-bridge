# Urban Mobility Data Models

This repository is going to be archived (Jan-2020) and subsequent works will be carried out in [Smart data models] (https://github.com/smart-data-models) repositories. Further questions on migration. alberto.abella@fiware.org

## Introduction

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), also known as GTFS static or
static transit, defines a common format for public transportation schedules and
associated geographic information. GTFS "feeds" let public transit agencies
publish their transit data and developers write applications that consume that
data in an interoperable way.

These data models are intended to map GTFS feeds into FIWARE NGSI content. Main
entities are:

-   [GtfsAgency](./GtfsAgency/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsStop](./GtfsStop/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsStation](./GtfsStation/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsAccessPoint](./GtfsAccessPoint/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsRoute](./GtfsRoute/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsTrip](./GtfsTrip/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsStopTime](./GtfsStopTime/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsService](./GtfsService/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsCalendarRule](./GtfsCalendarRule/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsCalendarDateRule](./GtfsCalendarDateRule/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsFrequency](./GtfsFrequency/doc/spec.md)
-   [GtfsTransferRule](./GtfsTransferRule/doc/spec.md)
