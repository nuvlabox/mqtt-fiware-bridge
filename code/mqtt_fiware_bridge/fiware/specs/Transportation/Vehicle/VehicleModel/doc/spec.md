    }
}
```

### key-value pairs Example

Sample uses simplified representation for data consumers `?options=keyValues`

```json
{
    "id": "vehiclemodel:econic",
    "type": "VehicleModel",
    "name": "MBenz-Econic2014",
    "brandName": "Mercedes Benz",

    "manufacturerName": "Daimler",
    "vehicleType": "lorry",
    "cargoVolume": 1000,
    "fuelType": "diesel"
}
```

### LD Example

Sample uses the NGSI-LD representation

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:VehicleModel:vehiclemodel:econic",
    "type": "VehicleModel",
    "name": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": "MBenz-Econic2014"
    },
